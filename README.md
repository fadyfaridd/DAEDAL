> Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) are emerging as a powerful alternative to the dominant Autoregressive Large Language Models, offering efficient parallel generation and capable global context modeling. However, the practical application of DLLMs is hindered by a critical architectural constraint: the need for a statically predefined generation length. This static length allocation leads to a problematic trade-off: insufficient lengths cripple performance on complex tasks, while excessive lengths incur significant computational overhead and sometimes result in performance degradation.

## 💻 Overview

<br>

We introduce DAEDAL, a training-free, two-phase inference strategy designed to listen to these internal signals and empower the DLM with dynamic, variable-length denoising.

1. <strong>Initial Length Adjustment:</strong> Before the main denoising begins, DAEDAL starts with a short, unified length. It performs a quick check: "Based on this prompt, is the currently allocated length sufficient?" It measures this by checking the EOS confidence at the end of the sequence. If the confidence is low, the model is signaling the budget is insufficient. DAEDAL then expands the length by adding more `[MASK]` tokens and repeats this check until the model is confident the budget is sufficient. This sets a reasonable global length for the task.

2. <strong>Iterative Mask Insertion:</strong> During the step-by-step denoising process, DAEDAL continues to monitor the model's confidence. If it finds a specific `[MASK]` token that the model is extremely uncertain abou, it marks this as an "expansion point". DAEDAL intervenes by replacing that single `[MASK]` with a block of new `[MASK]`s. This dynamically inserts "breathing room" into the sequence exactly where the model needs it to elaborate on a complex thought or bridge a logical gap.

DAEDAL allows the DLM to autonomously decide its own response length on a per-problem basis. By resolving the static length constraint, DAEDAL unlocks new potential for DLLMs, bridging a critical gap with their Autoregressive counterparts and paving the way for more efficient and capable generation.
