About DAEDAL
DAEDAL stands for a design capable of denoising diffusion processes in large language models without additional training. It targets scenarios where diffusion-based inference can deliver superior quality to traditional auto-regressive generation, while keeping the process lightweight and adaptable to variable inference budgets. The project gathers ideas from diffusion theory, language modeling, and practical engineering to enable robust performance across a range of language tasks.

This repository is the official home for Beyond Fixed: Training-Free Variable-Length Denoising for Diffusion Large Language Models. It collects the ideas, reference implementations, experiments, and practical guidance needed to deploy diffusion-based LLMs with our training-free denoising framework. The work aims to help researchers, engineers, and product teams explore diffusion techniques for language tasks without incurring the usual training overhead.

Why this project matters
- Training-free denoising unlocks rapid experimentation. Teams can prototype and test ideas quickly without the cost of retraining models.
- Variable-length denoising adapts to resource constraints. Inference budgets change with deployment context, and the denoiser adjusts accordingly.
- Diffusion-based LLMs open new frontiers for long-form generation, summarization, reasoning, and dialogue. This project makes those capabilities more accessible.

Core Concepts
- Diffusion for language: Extending diffusion ideas, originally developed for vision, to large language models. We adapt diffusion steps to language tokens and model latent representations in a principled way.
- Denoising without training: The denoising module can be applied to pre-existing diffusion-based LLMs without retraining, leveraging the model’s native representations and the denoiser’s guidance signals.
- Variable-length denoising: The denoiser can adjust the number of steps or tokens it processes, allowing flexible trade-offs between speed and quality.
- Alignment with downstream tasks: The approach benefits tasks like long-form generation, complex reasoning, and conditional text synthesis, where fidelity to prompts and coherence across longer spans matter.

Features and Benefits
- Training-free denoising: No additional model training required.
- Flexible inference: Choose the denoising depth per prompt, per batch, or per time budget.
- Strong quality under constraints: Maintains coherence, fluency, and factual alignment with prompts.
- Easy integration: Designed to work with diffusion-based language models via a clean, modular interface.
- Transparent evaluation: Clear metrics and baselines to compare performance across configurations.

How It Works
- In diffusion-based language generation, a model iteratively refines a noisy latent representation into a text sequence. DAEDAL provides a denoiser that guides this refinement without altering the training regime of the base model.
- The denoiser leverages token-level and cross-attention cues to steer generation toward more accurate and coherent outputs.
- Variable-length operation enables early stopping or budget-driven denoising. Practitioners can allocate more steps to difficult prompts and fewer steps where text quality is already high.

System Requirements
- Operating Systems: Linux, Windows, macOS (supported via binaries or containerized environments)
- Python: 3.9.x or newer
- CUDA: CUDA-enabled GPUs for accelerated inference (optional but recommended)
- RAM: 8 GB minimum for basic runs; 16–32 GB recommended for longer prompts or larger models
- Disk: 5–20 GB for models, assets, and caches, depending on the size of the diffusion models
- Software dependencies: A curated stack of PyTorch or TensorFlow, plus supporting libraries for tokenization and I/O

How DAEDAL Differs from Other Approaches
- Training-free operation: Unlike approaches that require costly retraining, DAEDAL depends on a denoiser that leverages existing diffusion LLMs’ capabilities.
- Flexibility in inference: Variable-length denoising enables cost-aware generation, allowing teams to adapt to latency or budget constraints.
- Clear evaluation pathways: The project includes standard benchmarks and reproducibility guidelines, making it easier to compare with baselines.

Architecture and Components
- Denoiser Module: The core component that applies denoising guidance to the diffusion process. It integrates with the base diffusion model’s latent space and token-level representations.
- Inference Controller: Manages the denoiser's depth, budget, and step scheduling. It enables dynamic adjustment during a generation session.
- Compatibility Layer: Bridges diffusion LLMs with the denoiser, handling tokenization, attention masks, and interpretability signals.
